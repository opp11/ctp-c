/*
 * Parses the instructions in 'lines', converts them to their binary

 * In case if any errors with the instruction in lines, the funtion will still
 * return an array, print an error message, and á¸¿et_err will be set to 1.
 * The return value should ALWAYS be freed by the user program.

 * 	lines - The instructions to parse and compile.
 *	len   - The number if items in 'lines'. If the function was

 * returns:
 *	struct instr_t* - Array of instr_t structs which contain the binary
 *	                  representation of the instructions in 'lines'.
